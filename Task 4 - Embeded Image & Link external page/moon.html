    <h1><u> What is moon?</u></h1>
    <p>The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth largest moon in the solar system.The Moon's presence
        helps stabilize our planet's wobble and moderate our climate.The Moon's distance from Earth is about 240,000
        miles (385,000km).The Moon has a very thin atmosphere called an exosphere.<br>
        We usually see moon in the night sky and also during the day.Some other planets also have moons or natural
        satellites.
        Our moon is about a quarter the size of the Earth.Because it is far away it looks small, about half a degree
        wide.The gravity on the moon is one-sixth of the Earth's gravity.It means that something will be one-sixth as
        heavy on the Moon than on Earth. The Moon is a rocky and dusty place.It moves slowly away from the earth at a
        rate of 3.8cm per year,due to the effect of tidal dissipation.<br>
        Rocket parts are expected to fall on the Moon on March 4, 2022; Bill Gray (a mathematician and physicist) thinks
        that the parts are not from the carrier rocket that sent the Deep Space Climate Observatory satellite "to a
        gravitationally-stable Lagrange point", in 2015.

    <h1>Why moon is called moon?</h1>
    <p>The word moon can be traced to the word mōna, an Old English word from medieval times. Mōna shares its origins
        with the Latin words metri, which means to <b>measure, and mensis, which means month</b>. So, we see that the
        moon is called the moon because it is used to measure the months.</p>

    <h1><i> Who named the moon?</i></h1>
    <p>Earth's moon, the longest known of all, was given the name "Selene" by the Greeks and "Luna" by the Romans, each
        a goddess.
    </p>

    <h1><i>How old the moon is?</i></h1>
    <p> The moon is a very old soul, it turns out. A new analysis of lunar rocks brought to Earth by Apollo astronauts
        suggests that the moon formed <b>4.51 billion years ago — just 60 million years after the solar system</b>
        itself took shape
